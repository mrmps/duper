# Fashion Finder

Fashion Finder is a web application built with Next.js that helps users find similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. 

It allows users to upload images, which are stored in Cloudflare R2. It detects objects within the uploaded images using the Dupe API, crops these objects, and uploads the cropped images back to Cloudflare R2. Using SerpAPI, it performs visual searches to find similar fashion items based on both the original full image and the cropped images. The results are then returned as a list of products associated with each detected object.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

```env
